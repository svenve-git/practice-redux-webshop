# Webshop project

## User stories

- As a customer, I want to see an overview of the products available, sort
  them by price or popularity, and filter them by some meaningful distinction
  (for example "tag" or "category")

- As a customer, I want to always be able to see the amount of products in my
  "shopping cart" (i.e. on every page), and quickly navigate to the shopping cart page

- As a customer, I want to see whether (and if so, how many times) Iâ€™ve added
  a product to my cart, near the relevant products wherever these are shown
  (e.g. on the homepage or a product page)

- As a customer, I want to get more information on a product on a product-specific
  page

- As a customer, I want to be able to view my shopping cart, which products
  are in it, how many times, and what total price that adds up to. I also want to
  be able to adjust the number of items in that page, and to be able to empty
  the whole cart.
